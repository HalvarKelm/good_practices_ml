## Notes

Size of training set 30322
Percentage of Balanced data replaced by aerial images = 0.77%
Percentage of Balanced data replaced by tourist images = 6.45%

 - Distribution of testing set is different to all training sets (Addition rather than replacement)

## Feedback

#### Literature Search  / Management
 - Zotero!
 - Mendeley
#### Research Tools
 - Semantic Scholar
 - Iris.ai
 - researchrabbit
#### TSNE (Do on different scales and zoom in)
 - First only continents
 - Then sub-regions within continents
 - Then countries 
 - Be careful of Color Scheme!
 - Also plot the Embeddings of the prompts!
#### Training Model
 - Loss Function
 - Composition of Regional/Country Loss - Observe the scale difference as one is on 20 categories and the other 211

## Thoughts

#### Training Model
 - Cross Validation
 - Composition of Testing Dataset

#### Optimization
 - Activation Functions
 - Depth of Neural Networks
 - Always fix random seed
 - Is the initialization of model random??
