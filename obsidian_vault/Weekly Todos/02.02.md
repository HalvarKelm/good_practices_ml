## Notes

#### Explain our TSNE results
 - South africa is clustered with oceania!
 - Do an individual TSNE for Europe to observe what kind of structures exist within the continent
 - What kind of coverage is there for each country? Observe this paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971523000194
 - It seems to be generally grouped in terms of climate or latitude
 - Singapore and Japan are big clusters in the bottom right - Island + Modern + Urban?
 - North America is mixed in with Europe while south America is mixed with Asia, Oceania and South Africa

#### Run TSNE for our own images

#### Hyperparameter tuning with Ray?



#### Nice graph from other group
