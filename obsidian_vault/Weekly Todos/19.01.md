## Notes

#### Try and get the model to learn
 - Edit Learning Rate
 - Regional Cross Entropy - One Hot Encoding (Uniform distribution for all countries in region) 
 - Weighted loss mix of Country Cross entropy and Region cross entropy

#### Create Training / Validation / Testing datasets
 - First create Testing Set and remove these samples into new folder so they cannot be trained on
 - Training Set 1 - Full Geoguessr
 - Training Set 2 - Balanced Geoguessr
 - Training Set 3 - Balanced Geoguessr mixed with Tourist and Aerial Images


## To Do

#### Model
 - [ ] Include Regional Cross Entropy in Loss
 - [ ] Connect with Tensorboard (where are the files saved by self.writer)

#### Datasets
 - [ ] Create Training (70% Balanced Geoguessr)
 - [ ] Create Validation (15% Balanced Geoguessr)
 - [ ] Create Testing (15% Balanced Geoguessr, 20% Tourist, 20% Aerial)

#### t-SME
 - [ ] Test on Tourist and Aerial Images
