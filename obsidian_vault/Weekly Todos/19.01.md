## Notes

#### Try and get the model to learn
 - Edit Learning Rate
 - Regional Cross Entropy - One Hot Encoding (Uniform distribution for all countries in region) 
 - Weighted loss mix of Country Cross entropy and Region cross entropy

#### Create Training / Validation / Testing datasets
 - First create Testing Set and remove these samples into new folder so they cannot be trained on
 - Training Set 1 - Full Geoguessr
 - Training Set 2 - Balanced Geoguessr
 - Training Set 3 - Balanced Geoguessr mixed with Tourist and Aerial Images
