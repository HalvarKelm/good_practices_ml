 - When testing which composition of training set is best
	 - Geogeussr Unbalanced
	 - Geogeussr Balanced
	 - Geogeussr & BigFoto/Aerial
- Make sure the size of the training sets are the same - so replace images with BigFoto and keep the same training set size

Testing Dataset
 - What does this look like?
 - 

Optimizing (Only on unbalanced Geoguessr):
 - Learning Rate


 To Do:
- [ ] Send 'research questions and processes' document to Felix
- [ ] Do basic first training - now with image embedding and 'distances'
